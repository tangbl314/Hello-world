# Hello-world
This is a practice example of the tutorial I am following.
Hi there, I am a junior in the isat major. I plan on going into consulting after college or possibly the military; hopefully the Navy.
I enjoy eating authentic mexican tacos, especially carne asada.
I am different than most students you have ever had. Although I was born and raised in Northern Virginia, I attended a boarding school in the state of Wisconsin at St. Lawrence Seminary High School.
This is the edit I am making onto the readme-edits. Hopefully I am doing this correctly.
